          Research and development projects implemented by WTM Solutions
          in cooperation with maritime and industrial partners.

          Research project with LVR Flote – development and real-world testing
          of an exhaust gas purification reactor
        </h3>

        <p>
          SIA <strong>WTM Solutions</strong> and SIA <strong>LVR Flote</strong>
          implemented a joint research project aimed at developing and testing
          a prototype exhaust gas purification reactor for ship engines under
          real operating conditions.
        </p>

        <p>
          The project was carried out within the framework of the
          <strong>“Mechanical Engineering Competence Centre”</strong> and was
          supported by the <strong>EU Recovery Fund</strong> under the Latvian
          Recovery and Resilience Mechanism
          (project ID: 5.1.1.2.i.0/1/22/A/CFLA/006), as well as the operational
          programme “Increasing productivity through higher private investment
          volumes”.
        </p>

        <p>
          The research project (No. 3.3) started on
          <strong>1 September 2023</strong> and was completed on
          <strong>31 December 2024</strong>.
          Its main objective was to design and build an innovative prototype
          reactor for marine diesel engine exhaust gas purification, followed
          by validation through laboratory testing and real-environment trials.
        </p>

        <h4>Project implementation</h4>

        <p>
          During the project, WTM Solutions developed an exhaust gas purification
          reactor prototype using innovative technological approaches.
          Laboratory tests were performed to validate the concept before moving
          to full-scale testing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Real-world testing was carried out onboard the LVR Flote vessel
          <strong>“LĪVA”</strong>, where the prototype reactor was installed
          and operated under actual ship engine conditions.
        </p>

        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>Development of an exhaust gas purification reactor prototype</li>
          <li>Laboratory testing of the developed technology</li>
          <li>Full-scale real-environment testing onboard the vessel “LĪVA”</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Results and further development</h4>

        <p>
          The developed prototype technology has demonstrated unique results.
          These results are planned to be published in a separate press release
          after confirmation and certification by international laboratories
          and classification institutions.
        </p>

        <p>
          The pilot industrial facility installed onboard “LĪVA” enables
          continued full-scale testing and repeated laboratory verification,
          providing a solid foundation for further technological development
          and potential commercial implementation.
        </p>

        <h4>Continuing cooperation</h4>

        <p>
          Following the formal completion of the project, WTM Solutions and
          LVR Flote continue their cooperation. LVR Flote has publicly expressed
          strong interest in the project and its contribution to cleaner and
          more sustainable maritime transport through the adoption of
          innovative environmental technologies.
